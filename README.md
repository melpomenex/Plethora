## Overview

**Incrementum** is a sophisticated desktop application that combines **incremental reading** with **spaced repetition** to help you efficiently process and retain information from large volumes of content.

Built with modern technologies—Tauri, React, and Rust—it offers a beautiful, fast, and cross-platform learning environment that adapts to your needs.

### Core Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Incremental Reading** | Process large documents in small, manageable chunks over time |
| **Spaced Repetition** | Review content at scientifically-optimized intervals using FSRS-6, SM-18, SM-20, or SM-2 |
| **Import Flexibility** | Bring content from anywhere—PDFs, EPUBs, audiobooks, videos, websites, podcasts, Anki decks |
| **Smart Scheduling** | Know exactly when you'll review each card again with preview intervals |
| **Rich Analytics** | Track your progress, streaks, and performance metrics |

---

## ✨ Features

### 📚 Document Management

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Rust** toolchain (1.70+)
- **System dependencies** for your platform

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libxdo-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev
```

#### macOS

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### macOS Security: Opening Self-Signed Applications

When you first run Incrementum on macOS, you may encounter a security warning since the application is self-signed. This is normal for unsigned apps. Here's how to proceed:

**Method 1: Open via Finder (Recommended)**

1. In Finder, locate the `Incrementum.app`
2. Right-click (or Control-click) the app → Open
3. A security warning dialog will appear
4. Click "Open" again to confirm

The right-click → Open path adds a security exception for that application.

**Method 2: Allow via System Settings**

1. Try to open the app normally (double-click). It will fail with a security warning
2. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down to the security section
4. Look for a message saying "Incrementum was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"
5. Click "Open Anyway" and confirm with "Open" in the dialog

After following either method, macOS will remember your choice, and you can open the app normally in the future.

#### Windows

No additional dependencies required.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository (includes whisper.cpp submodule)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/melpomenex/incrementum-tauri.git
cd incrementum-tauri

# If you already cloned without submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run tauri:dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri:build
```

The production bundle will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Download Pre-built Binaries

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Step 1: Import Your First Document

```
Documents → Import Document → Choose source
```

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📁 **Local Files** | Select PDF, EPUB, or text files from your computer |
| 🎧 **Audiobook / Audio** | Import audiobooks or audio files (MP3, M4A, M4B, FLAC, etc.) with auto-transcription |
| 🎬 **Video** | Import video files (MP4, WebM, MOV, MKV, etc.) with local playback and transcription |
| 🌐 **URL** | Enter any web URL to fetch and process content |
| 📺 **YouTube** | Import YouTube videos or playlists |
| 📄 **Arxiv** | Paste Arxiv ID or URL for research papers |
| 📸 **Screenshot** | Capture your screen directly |
| 🃏 **Anki** | Import .apkg files from Anki |
| 📦 **SuperMemo** | Import ZIP exports from SuperMemo |

---

### Step 2: Process Content

Documents are automatically **segmented** and **extracts** are created.

- Review extracts in the **Extracts** tab
- Edit, categorize, and tag them
- Convert them to learning items (Flashcards)

---

### Step 3: Start Reviewing

```
Review → See due cards → Rate your recall (1-4)
```

**Rating Scale**

| Rating | Label | Description | Next Review |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 Again | Forgot completely | ~10 minutes |
| 2 | 🟡 Hard | Remembered with difficulty | ~1-2 days |
| 3 | 🟢 Good | Remembered easily | ~5-7 days |
| 4 | 🔵 Easy | Too easy | ~10-14 days |

> **Preview Intervals**: See exactly when each card will appear next before you rate!

---

### Step 4: Track Progress

```
Analytics → View stats, charts, and streaks
```
